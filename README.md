At PwnzzAI Shop, every slice serves up a helping of **holistic AI security instruction**. This hands-on learning platform prepares professionals to understand the protection of **AI technologies broadly** delivered through an engaging, practical pizza shop scenario.

Just as an incorrect ingredient can spoil a pizza, a flawed prompt or inadequate architecture can leave AI technologies vulnerable to severe threats, including information breaches, intellectual property theft, or illegitimate access.

Here, you'll explore **practical examples** of how vulnerabilities are created, exploited, and mitigated. You need to login as alice/alice or bob/bob for some pages. Grab a slice, dig in, and discover how delicious learning about AI security can be.

## About

PwnzzAI Shop represents a **hands-on learning platform** purposefully built for instruction on AI technology protection. This intentionally insecure Flask-based web application showcases an extensive array of AI security weaknesses via an immersive pizza shop experience.

**Founding partner**: [OWASP AI Exchange](https://owaspai.org/)

### Scope and Learning Goals

PwnzzAI is designed as a comprehensive, evolving learning platform aligned with the **[AI Exchange risk taxonomy](https://owaspai.org/docs/ai_security_overview/#threats-overview)** Its scope expands progressively in step with OWASP AI Exchange security analysis frameworks and defensive guidance, ensuring long-term relevance as AI security practices mature.
The project currently incorporates the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, with an architecture intentionally mapped to AI Exchange risk classifications. Over time, PwnzzAI aims to mature into a structured learning ecosystem that supports:

- AI protection and defense training, including self-directed learning paths

- Hands-on security training programs with practical, scenario-driven exercises

- Team-based learning initiatives for security engineers and practitioners

- End-to-end AI security education, spanning design, development, deployment, and operations
  
## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using our pre-built Docker image:

1. Pull the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/maryammouzarani2024/pwnzzai:latest
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/maryammouzarani2024/pwnzzai:latest
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to see the application. Start from the Basic page and setup your lab.

The image already includes Ollama so you only need to pull the required models as described in the lab setup section of the Basics page. 

### Option 2: Local Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install  the dependencies:
   
   (If you do not want to use Ollam, you can remove or comment the line "curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh" from install.sh)
   
   
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

4. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to see the application. Start from the Basic page and setup your lab. 


If you need more details, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv3PP6xbS3A&t=26s"> this walkthrough </a>, that shows, step-by-step, how to set up the app using either options.
