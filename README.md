<img src="application/static/img/index.png" alt="PwnzzAI Shop" width="200">

At PwnzzAI Shop, every slice serves up a helping of **holistic AI security instruction**. This hands-on learning platform prepares professionals to understand the protection of **AI technologies broadly** delivered through an engaging, practical pizza shop scenario.

Just as an incorrect ingredient can spoil a pizza, a flawed prompt or inadequate architecture can leave AI technologies vulnerable to severe threats, including information breaches, intellectual property theft, or illegitimate access.

Here, you'll explore **practical examples** of how vulnerabilities are created, exploited, and mitigated. You need to login as alice/alice or bob/bob for some pages. Grab a slice, dig in, and discover how delicious learning about AI security can be.

## About

PwnzzAI Shop represents a **hands-on learning platform** purposefully built for instruction on AI technology protection. This intentionally insecure Flask-based web application showcases an extensive array of AI security weaknesses via an immersive pizza shop experience.

**Founding partner**: [OWASP AI Exchange](https://owaspai.org/)

### Scope and Learning Goals

PwnzzAI is designed as a comprehensive, evolving learning platform aligned with the **[AI Exchange risk taxonomy](https://owaspai.org/docs/ai_security_overview/#threats-overview)** Its scope expands progressively in step with OWASP AI Exchange security analysis frameworks and defensive guidance, ensuring long-term relevance as AI security practices mature.
The project currently incorporates the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, with an architecture intentionally mapped to AI Exchange risk classifications. Over time, PwnzzAI aims to mature into a structured learning ecosystem that supports:

- AI protection and defense training, including self-directed learning paths

- Hands-on security training programs with practical, scenario-driven exercises

- Team-based learning initiatives for security engineers and practitioners

- End-to-end AI security education, spanning design, development, deployment, and operations
  
## Setup Instructions

Choose one of these 3 ways to run PwnzzAI:

1. Docker with both images (PwnzzAI + Ollama)
2. Docker with your own local/remote Ollama and only the PwnzzAI image
3. Run the source code yourself

### Before You Start (All Options)

1. Install Docker Desktop from `https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop`.
2. Open Docker Desktop and wait until it says Docker is running.
3. Install Git if you do not already have it.
4. Clone this repository and enter it:

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd PwnzzAI
```

### Option 1: Docker (PwnzzAI + Ollama)

Use this option if you want Docker to run both the PwnzzAI app and Ollama for you.

1. Start both containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

2. Verify both services are running:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

3. Open the app in your browser:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

4. In the app, go to the Basics page and run Ollama setup to pull models.

5. Follow logs if needed:

```bash

# App logs
docker compose logs -f pwnzzai-app

# Ollama logs (optional)
docker compose logs -f ollama
```

6. Stop everything when done:

```bash
docker compose down
```

7. Optional full reset (removes saved Ollama models too):

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

If you publish the app image under another registry path, override the image name when starting:

```bash
PWNZZAI_IMAGE=ghcr.io/your-org/pwnzzai:latest docker compose up -d
```

### Option 2: Docker (Your Own Ollama + PwnzzAI Image)

Use this option if Ollama is already running somewhere else and you only want to run PwnzzAI in Docker.

If you run Ollama on WSL and PwnzzAI in Docker, see
[`OLLAMA_CONNECTION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](OLLAMA_CONNECTION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
for connectivity fixes (`Connection refused`, `host.docker.internal`, binding, and env validation).

1. Keep your Ollama service running.

2. If your Ollama runs on a remote machine, set `OLLAMA_HOST` first.

Linux/macOS:

```bash
export OLLAMA_HOST=http://your-ollama-server:11434
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:OLLAMA_HOST="http://your-ollama-server:11434"
```

3. Start PwnzzAI using the external Ollama compose file:


Linux/macOS:

```bash
export OLLAMA_HOST=http://your-ollama-server:11434
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:OLLAMA_HOST="http://your-ollama-server:11434"
```

4.  Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to see the application. Start from the Basic page and setup your lab.


5. Follow app logs if needed:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.external-ollama.yml logs -f pwnzzai-app
```

6. Stop it when done:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.external-ollama.yml down
```



### Option 3: Run Source Code Yourself

Use this option if you want to run Python directly (without Docker for the app).

1. Install Python 3.11.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.

Linux/macOS:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Make sure Ollama is available:
`http://localhost:11434` or another endpoint via `OLLAMA_HOST`.

5. Run the app:

```bash
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080
```

6. Open:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```
